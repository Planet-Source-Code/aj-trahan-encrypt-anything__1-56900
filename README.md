## Encrypt ANYTHING


</div>

### Description

I use winsock quite a bit with my programming. This was created to send encrypted information via the internet from client to server or server to client. The module picks a random number to encrypt each letter with and stores it in the information. (example L:23:E:3:T:34:) and then the numbers used are encrypted with it as well. Please let me know what you think of it and vote as well. Thannks in advance ~James Miller
